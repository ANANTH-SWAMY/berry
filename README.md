A healthy, bite-sized window manager written in C over the XLib library.

# Description
`berry` is a floating window manager that responds to X events and manages window decorations.

`berryc` is a small client that sends X events to manage windows and configuration settings.

Much like `bspwm` and `windowchef`, `berry` does not handle keyboard inputs.
Instead, a program like `sxhkd` is needed to translate input events to `berryc` commands.
